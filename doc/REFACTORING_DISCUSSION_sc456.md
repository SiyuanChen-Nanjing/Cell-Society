## Refactoring Review
by Siyuan Chen sc456
* Duplication
	* Resolved some duplication of variables in Main
	* Potential refactoring in next sprint (or current sprint): Use Groovy to remove duplications in Simulation.initialize()
* Communication
	* Added braces for if/for/while statements
	* Fixed some issues with nested if statements
* Code Smells
	* All indentation errors, no idea why that happened
